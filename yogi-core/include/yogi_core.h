//! have to match the version of the actual library that is loaded at runtime.
//!
//! This header file constitutes the bindings for the C language and therefore,
//! the version macros defined here denote the version of these bindings.

//! Disables support for variables in the configuration
//!
//! Variables are used to define common values (or parts of values) in a
//! pre-defined  section. They can then be used in multiple other parts of the
//! configuration.
//!
//! \note
//!   Variables can *not* be used in keys.
//!
//! Variables are defined in the *variables* section of the configuration:
//!
//! \code
//! {
//!   "variables": {
//!     "ROOT":         "/usr/share/my-app",
//!     "DATA_DIR":     "${ROOT}/data"
//!     "DURATION":     30,
//!     "MAX_DURATION": "${DURATION}",
//! ...
//! \endcode
//! These variables can then be used anywhere in the configuration, even in the
//! *variables* section itself as shown above.
//!
//! \note
//!   Even if the value of a variable is not a string, the placeholder *${name}*
//!   always has to be a string to conform to the JSON format. When resolving a
//!   placeholder for a non-string variable, the type of the target value will
//!   be changed accordingly if and only if the placeholder is surrounded by
//!   quotation marks as shown for the *MAX_DURATION* variable above. Otherwise,
//!   the target value will remain a string and the placeholder will be replaced
//!   with the stringified value of the variable.

 * it connects to them via TCP to retrieve further information such as their
 * name, description and network name. If the network names match, two branches
 * attempt to authenticate with each other by securely comparing passwords.
 * Once authentication succeeds and there is no other known branch with the same
 * path then the branches can actively communicate as part of the Yogi network.
 *
 * The branch is configured via the \p config parameter. The configuration
 * object will only be used while constructing the branch, i.e. the branch will
 * not keep any references to it. The supplied configuration must have the
 * following structure:
 *
 * \code
 *   {
 *     "name":                   "Fan Controller",
 *     "description":            "Controls a fan via PWM",
 *     "path":                   "/Cooling System/Fan Controller",
 *     "network_name":           "Hardware Control",
 *     "network_password":       "secret",
 *     "advertising_interfaces": ["localhost"],
 *     "advertising_address":    "ff02::8000:2439",
 *     "advertising_port":       13531,
 *     "advertising_interval":   1.0,
 *     "timeout":                3.0,
 *     "ghost_mode":             false,
 *     "tx_queue_size":          1000000,
 *     "rx_queue_size":          100000
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * All of the properties are optional and if unspecified (or set to _null_),
 * their respective default values will be used (see \ref CV). The properties
 * have the following meaning:
 *  - __name__: Name of the branch.
 *  - __description__: Description of the branch.
 *  - __path__: Path of the branch in the network. Must start with a slash.
 *  - __network_name__: Name of the network to join.
 *  - __network_password__: Password for the network.
 *  - __advertising_interfaces__: Network interfaces to use for advertising.
 *    Valid strings are Unix device names ("eth0", "en5", "wlan0"), adapter
 *    names on Windows ("Ethernet", "VMware Network Adapter WMnet1") or MAC
 *    addresses ("11:22:33:44:55:66"). Furthermore, the special strings
 *    "localhost" and "all" can be used to denote loopback and all available
 *    interfaces respectively.
 *  - __advertising_address__: Multicast address to use for advertising, e.g.
 *    239.255.0.1 for IPv4 or ff02::8000:1234 for IPv6.
 *  - __advertising_port__: Port to use for advertising.
 *  - __advertising_interval__: Time between advertising messages. Must be at
 *    least 1 ms.
 *  - __timeout__: Amount of time of inactivity before a connection is
 *    considered to be broken. Must be at least 1 ms.
 *  - __ghost_mode__: Set to true to activate ghost mode.
 *  - __tx_queue_size__: Size of the send queues for remote branches.
 *  - __rx_queue_size__: Size of the receive queues for remote branches.
 *
 * Advertising and establishing connections can be limited to certain network
 * interfaces via the _interface_ property. The default is to use all
 * available interfaces.
 *
 * Setting the _ghost_mode_ property to _true_ prevents the branch from actively
 * participating in the Yogi network, i.e. the branch will not advertise itself
 * and it will not authenticate in order to join a network. However, the branch
 * will temporarily connect to other branches in order to obtain more detailed
 * information such as name, description, network name and so on. This is useful
 * for obtaining information about active branches without actually becoming
 * part of the Yogi network.
 *
 * \note
 *   Even if the communication between branches is not encrypted, the
 *   authentication process via passwords is always done in a secure manner.
 *
 * \attention
 *   The _tx_queue_size_ and _rx_queue_size_ properties affect every branch
 *   connection and can therefore consume a large amount of memory. For example,
 *   in a network of 10 branches where these properties are set to 1 MB, the
 *   resulting memory used for the queues would be 10 x 2 x 1 MB = 20 MB for
 *   each of the 10 branches. This value grows with the number of branches

 *
 * The properties above have the following meaning:
 *  - __port__: HTTPS port to use.
 *  - __interfaces__: Network interfaces to use. Valid strings are Unix devices
 *    names ("eth5", "en5", "wlan0"), adapter names on Windows ("Ethernet",
 *    "WMware Network Adapter WMnet1") or MAC addresses ("11:22:33:44:55:66").
 *    Furthermore, the special strings "localhost" and "all" can be used to
 *    denote loopback and all available interfaces respectively.
 *  - __timeout__: Time of inactivity before terminating a client connection.
 *  - __http_header_limit__: Maximum HTTP header size in bytes for incoming HTTP
 *    requests. If the header is larger then the connection will be closed.
 *  - __http_body_limit__: Maximum HTTP body size in bytes for incoming HTTP
 *    requests. If the body is larger then the connection will be closed.
 *  - __test_mode__: Set to true to enable functionality for testing both server
 *    and client code. Should only be enabled during development.
 *  - __compress_assets__: Allow the use of compression when transferring
 *    static assets such as HTML or JavaScript files.
 *  - __cache_size__: Size of the file cache in bytes. Used to keep assets in
 *    memory instead of reading them from disk to improve performance. A value
 *    of 0 disables the cache entirely.
 *
 * The sub-sections following the properties above are described in more detail
 * in the next paragraphs:
 *
 * The __routes__ section describes both the content for static routes and the
 * level of access that users have to static and custom routes. The excerpt
 * below shows how to configure the three different types of routes, namely
 * static routes mapping to the file system (_filesystem_), static routes with
 * their content in the configuration (_content_) and custom routes which are
 * created via the YOGI_WebRouteCreate() function (_custom_):
 *
 * \code
 *   "routes": {
 *     "/": {
 *       "type":        "filesystem",
 *       "path":        "www",
 *       "permissions": { "*": ["GET"] },
 *       "enabled":     true
 *     },
 *     "/secret": {
 *       "type":        "content",
 *       "mime":        "text/plain",
 *       "owner":       "luke",
 *       "permissions": { "users": ["GET"], "owner": ["PUT"] },
 *       "content":     "I am your father",
 *       "enabled":     true
 *     },
 *     "/messages": {
 *       "type":        "custom",
 *       "permissions": { "*": ["GET"], "users": ["POST"] }
 *     },
 *     "/messages/ *": {
 *       "type":        "custom",
 *       "permissions": { "*": ["GET"], "owner": ["DELETE"] },
 *       "enabled":     true
 *     }
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The _filesystem_ route above maps URIs to the server's root URI and below to
 * the files found in the file system under the (here relative to the current
 * working directory of the process) "www" directory. The optional _owner_
 * property assigns a user to _own_ that resource which can be used in the
 * _permissions_ section to grant specific permissions to that user. The
 * _permissions_ section describes the level of access that users belonging to
 * certain groups have. The _enabled_ property is also optional and can be used
 * to disable a route without removing it from the configuration. If this
 * property is not specified it is implicitly set to _true_.
 *
 * \note
 *   If a client issues a _GET_ request on a _filesystem_ route leading to a
 *   directory then the corresponding _index.html_ file in that directory will
 *   be delivered if it exists.
 *
 * A single "*" in the URI of a route is a whilecard for every immediate
 * sub-path while "**" applies to every path below, no matter how deep. Routes
 * that have more specific URIs override the properties inherited by routes
 * with less specific URIs, i.e. in the example above, the "/messages/ *" route
 * overrides the properties inherited from the "/messages" route for all paths
 * below "/messages".
 *
 * \attention
 *   There should not be a space in any of the ".../ *" strings in the
 *   configuration. The space has only been added to a avoid C compiler warnings
 *   about the start of a comment block inside a comment.
 *
 * The access control lists (ACLs) in the _permissions_ section consist of a
 * dictionary mapping groups to allowed request methods. There are two groups
 * that have a special meaning: "*" and "owner". The "*" group means every user,
 * logged in or not. The "owner" group means the user who _owns_ the resource
 * which can have a different meaning depending on the resource. For example, in
 * the "/secret" section the owner is explicitly set to the user "luke" which
 * while in the "/messages/ *" section the custom route could assign the owner
 * of a message to the user who created that message using a _POST_ request on
 * the "/messages" route.
 *
 * \note
 *   Users are granted the combination of all permissions that apply for them.
 *   For example, in the "/secret" route above, the _owner_ is set to the user
 *   _luke_. The permissions grant _GET_ access to everyone and _PUT_ access
 *   to the owner, i.e. _luke_. The end result is that _luke_ has both _GET_ and
 *   _PUT_ access to the route.
 *
 * The __api_permissions__ section sets the permissions for each built-in API
 * endpoints. Any API endpoints not listed here are inaccessible for all but
 * unrestricted users.
 *
 * The __authentication__ section configures the authentication service. The
 * default configuration (see above) uses the configuration itself to retrieve
 * user and group information. By default, only the _admin_ user and the two
 * groups _admins_ and _users_ are created. The _admin_ user's default password
 * is "admin", stored in the configuration as a hashed value using SHA-256. The
 * _unrestricted_ property in the _admins_ group section is optional and _false_
 * by default; setting it to _true_ grants the members of the group every
 * possible permission for every route and API endpoint without having to grant
 * those permissions explicitly in the relevant sections.
 *
 * The _readonly_ property can be used to write-protect the users and groups
 * database. Note that for the _config_ provider, setting _readonly_ to false
 * will save changes in memory only. Any changes will be lost once the server
 * gets destroyed.
 *
 * In order to use external files to store users and groups, the following
 * configuration can be used:
 *
 * \code
 *   "authentication": {
 *     "provider":    "files",
 *     "readonly":    false,
 *     "users_file":  "users.json",
 *     "groups_file": "groups.json"
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The external users and groups files have to be in JSON format and contain the
 * _users_ and _groups_ sections respectively directly under the root object,
 * with the same structure as the default configuration above.
 *
 * \note
 *   The _users_file_ and _groups_file_ can be set to the same file if having
 *   both users and groups in a single file is desired.
 *
 * The __ssl__ section configures the encryption of the HTTPS and WSS
 * connections. The private key, certificate chain and DH parameters can be put
 * directly into the server configuration as shown in the default configuration
 * above. However, in order to use external files, the following can be used:
 *
 * \code
 *   "ssl": {
 *     "private_key_file":       "key.pem",
 *     "private_key_password":   "password",
 *     "certificate_chain_file": "cert.pem",
 *     "dh_params_file":         "dh_params.pem"
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The external files have to use the PEM file format. If the private key file
 * is encrypted, its password has to be supplied in _private_key_password_.
 *
 * \attention
 *   Use the default private key only for testing since the key is publicly
 *   available! You can create your own key and a self-signed certificate using
 *   OpenSSL or services like letsencrypt.org.
 *
 * \note
 *   The DH parameters can be left at their default values since this does not
 *   pose a security issue.
 *
 * The supplied \p context will be used for housekeeping and for accepting
 * incoming connection requests. As long as no workers have been added using
 * YOGI_WebServerAddWorker(), \p context will also be used to handle client
 * requests.
 *
 * \param[out] server   Pointer to the server handle
 * \param[in]  context  The context to use (set to NULL to use the branch's
 *                      context)

/*!
 * Creates a client-controllable web process.
 *
 * A web process is a potentially long-running operation controlled by the
 * client. Examples are performing computationally expensive operations such as
 * image recognition or running external programs on the server.
 *
 * This function registers a handler function \p which is called whenever a
 * client starts a web process, sends input to the process or cancels it (see
 * \ref WPA). In order to send process output and status updates back to the
 * client, YOGI_WebProcessUpdate() has to be called.
 *
 * The handler function \p fn will be called upon the client's request:
 *  -# __res__: #YOGI_OK or error code in case of a failure (see \ref EC)
 *  -# __wpid__: Web process ID to identify a new or running process
 *  -# __user__: User issuing the request or NULL if the client hasn't logged in
 *  -# __wpa__: Requested web process action (see \WPA)
 *  -# __data__: Start of the received parameters or input data from the client
 *  -# __sizes__: Lenths of the individual data blocks (see below for details)
 *  -# __userarg__: Value of \p userarg
 *
 * The _data_ parameter contains either the parameters to start the process with
 * or input data to be sent to the process. The concept is the same as running
 * processes in a terminal: They are started with a set of parameters (i.e.
 * argc/argv) and input can be sent to them through the standard input (stdin).
 *
 * The _sizes_ is a -1-terminated array containing the sizes of the individual
 * data blocks in _data_. For input data, _sizes_ will only contain a single
 * size, e.g. for 10 bytes of received input data, _sizes_ will consist of the
 * values [10, -1]. For process parameters, _size_ will contain as many sizes
 * as parameters, e.g. for 3 received process parameters, _sizes_ consists of
 * values like [12, 34, 56, -1]. In this example, the first 12 bytes in _data_
 * make up the first parameter, the next 34 bytes make up the second parameter
 * and the following 56 bytes make up the third parameter.
 *
 * Having received a request and \p fn having been called, one or more calls to
 * YOGI_WebProcessUpdate() have to be made in order to inform the client about
 * new output from the process or a change in its state. In case of connection
 * errors such as a disconnected client \p will be called with a corresponding
 * error and the _wpid_ of the process.
 *
 * \param[out] wproc    Pointer to the web process handle
 * \param[in]  server   The server to use
 * \param[in]  name     Name (identifier) of the process (e.g. "echo")
